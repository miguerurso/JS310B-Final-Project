    <span class="dropcap">W</span>elcome to the realm! It's a place where all things are possible such as magic spells, magical creatures and beasts and even you can even commune with the Gods.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You are a mighty hero-for-hire. You travel the Realm to learn all of its secrets, view all of its mighty sights, and slay its evil and mighty beasts by picking up bounty-hunting work to make your coin. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is morning, and your travels bring you to a small mountain village. As you seek some breakfast at the local tavern and shop for essentials at the local market, you hear the townsfolk describe a beast that is terrorizing the village at dusk. The villagers are scared to even come out of their homes past sunset, for this beast has gone as far as killing innocent villagers who have crossed its path by accident. You meet with the Lord of the village and learn that the beast lives in a cave at the top of the mountain, and comes down the mountain at night into the town hunting for food. The Lord of the village offers you a great amount of coin in exchange for slaying the best and bring peace to the town. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You accept the job, and decide to climb the mountain immediately and slay the beast so the village doesn't have to go through another night of terror. You arrive at the top of the mountain at sunset, just as the beast awakens from his slumber to commence another night of feasting&#8230;and so begins the Bounty!
