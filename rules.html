    <p class="rules-copy"> You have 40 seconds to take down the beast by bringing his Health Points (HP) down to 0 to win the game. 
    However, if the beast brings your HP down to 0 OR if you can not defeat the beast before the time runs out, you lose. </p>
    
    <p class="subheader">3 - Game Mechanics</p>
    
    <p class="rules-copy"></p>This game is a turn-based game, in which Your Hero and your opponent can make one move per turn. When the move is completed, the next player has their turn. 
    <br/>
    <br>
    Your hero will have several options to chose from during their turn: 
    <br/>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Attack:</i> The attack option is the default. The attack option will have your hero attack with their weapon. The damage dealt to your opponent will be a random number that will fall with in their attack point base range.</li>
        
        <li><i>Primal Attack:</i>The Primal attack is a special attack that is exponentially stronger that your base attack and will deal a significant amount of damage to your opponent. Be sure to use this attack ONLY when needed as the side effect of this attack is that it will sap some of your HP.</li>
        
        <li><i>Item:</i> Allows you to access your travel pack and utilize items with in. Certain items can deal damage to your opponent while other items can have a boost or healing property to your Hero. Items are expendable, once you use them and run out of inventory of them you cannot use them again.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
